# Arduino PC Diagnostic tool thing

I took up the challenge to learn how to use and program an Arduino UNO R3 with a breadboard, 1602A 16x2 LCD Display, 
and to essentially output stuff like CPU Usage/Temps, Battery status etc. directly to the LCD, using a companion script (only python3 for now).

The final goal of this project is:
- [ ] Output a nice amount of information about the PC;
- [ ] Remember the last set of info in *some* memory, for when PC power dies out (and using an external battery to power the arduino circuit);
- [ ] Have status LEDs for states like disconnected, connected but without companion, successfully connected, etc.;


Goals will either be completed or added as progress is made, and I'll add what I've learned as time goes on.

I'll try my best to document this as good as possible.
